# OmniTool

Control a Windows 11 VM with OmniParser + your vision model of choice.

## Highlights:

1. **OmniParser V2** is 60% faster than V1 and now understands a wide variety of OS, app and inside app icons!
2. **OmniBox** uses 50% less disk space than other Windows VMs for agent testing, whilst providing the same computer use API
3. **OmniTool** supports out of the box the following vision models - OpenAI (4o/o1/o3-mini), DeepSeek (R1), Qwen (2.5VL) or Anthropic Computer Use

## Notes:

1. Though **OmniParser V2** can run on a CPU, we have separated this out if you want to run it fast on a GPU machine
2. The **OmniBox** Windows 11 VM docker is dependent on KVM so can only run quickly on Windows and Linux. This can run on a CPU machine (doesn't need GPU).
3. The Gradio UI can also run on a CPU machine. We suggest running **omnibox** and **gradio** on the same CPU machine and **omniparserserver** on a GPU server.

## Setup

1. **omniparserserver**:

   a. If you already have a conda environment for OmniParser, you can use that. Else follow the following steps to create one

   b. Ensure conda is installed with `conda --version` or install from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)

   c. Navigate to the root of the repo with `cd OmniParser`

   d. Create a conda python environment with `conda create -n "omni" python==3.11`

   e. Set the python environment to be used with `conda activate omni`

   f. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   g. Continue from here if you already had the conda environment.

   h. Ensure you have the V2 weights downloaded in weights folder (**ensure caption weights folder is called icon_caption_florence**). If not download them with:
   ```
   rm -rf weights/icon_detect weights/icon_caption weights/icon_caption_florence 
   for folder in icon_caption icon_detect; do huggingface-cli download microsoft/OmniParser-v2.0 --local-dir weights --repo-type model --include "$folder/*"; done
   mv weights/icon_caption weights/icon_caption_florence
   ```

   h. Navigate to the server directory with `cd OmniParser/omnitool/omniparserserver`

   i. Start the server with `python -m omniparserserver`

2. **omnibox**:

   a. Ensure you have 30GB of space remaining (5GB for ISO, 400MB for Docker container, 20GB for storage folder)

   b. Install Docker Desktop

   c. Visit [Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-windows-11-enterprise.html), accept the Terms of Service, and download a **Windows 11 Enterprise Evaluation (90-day trial, English, United States)** ISO file [~6GB]. Rename the file to `custom.iso` and copy it to the directory `OmniParser/omnitool/omnibox/vm/win11iso`

   d. Navigate to vm management script directory with`cd OmniParser/omnitool/omnibox/scripts`

   e. Build the docker container [400MB] and install the ISO to a storage folder [20GB] with `./manage_vm.sh create`. The process is shown in the screenshots below and will take 20-90 mins depending on download speeds (commonly around 60 mins). When complete the terminal will show `VM + server is up and running!`. You can see the apps being installed in the VM by looking at the desktop via the NoVNC viewer (http://localhost:8006/vnc.html?view_only=1&autoconnect=1&resize=scale). The terminal window shown in the NoVNC viewer will not be open on the desktop after the setup is done. If you can see it, wait and don't click around!

   f. After creating the first time it will store a save of the VM state in `vm/win11storage`. You can then manage the VM with `./manage_vm.sh start` and `./manage_vm.sh stop`. To delete the VM, use `./manage_vm.sh delete` and delete the `OmniParser/omnitool/omnibox/vm/win11storage` directory.


> [!note] You can now create and manage a Linux VM, use the script with commands like:
> 
> `./manage_vm.sh create --linux` to create a Linux VM
> `./manage_vm.sh start --linux` to start a Linux VM
> `./manage_vm.sh create` to create a Windows VM (default)
> `./manage_vm.sh stop --windows` to explicitly stop a Windows VM

In macOS you may need to turn off _Airplay Receiver_ to avoid conflicts with Omnibox running on port `5000`, see this [Stack Overflow thread for more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72369320/why-always-something-is-running-at-port-5000-on-my-mac).


3. **gradio**:

   a. Navigate to the gradio directory with `cd OmniParser/omnitool/gradio`

   b. Ensure you have activated the conda python environment with `conda activate omni`

   c. Start the server with `python app.py --windows_host_url localhost:8006 --omniparser_server_url localhost:8000`

   d. Open the URL in the terminal output, set your API Key and start playing with the AI agent!

## Common setup errors
### OmniBox install taking a while
If your internet speed is slow and you want a minimal VM with less preinstalled apps comment out lines 57 to 350 in this [file](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser/blob/master/omnitool/omnibox/vm/win11setup/setupscripts/setup.ps1) that defines all the apps to install when you first create the container + VM. Ensure that you follow factory reset instructions from the next section when creating your VM to wipe any previous omnibox setup.

### Validation errors: Windows Host is not responding
If you get this error in Gradio after clicking the submit button, this indicates that the server running in the VM that accepts commands from Gradio and then moves the mouse/ keyboard isn't available. You can verify this by running `curl http://localhost:5000/probe`. Ensure your `omnibox` is fully finished setting up (should no longer have a terminal window). Refer to the omnibox section for timing on that. If you have set up your omnibox, it may be a matter of waiting a little.

If waiting 10 mins doesn't help. Try stopping (`./manage_vm.sh stop`) and starting (`./manage_vm.sh start`) your omnibox VM with the script commands.

Then, if that doesn't work, delete your VM (`./manage_vm.sh delete`) leaving the storage folder and then run create again. It will be fast as it will use the existing storage folder.

Finally, if that still doesn't work and you want to fully reset your VM to factory settings (create a new VM):
1. run `./manage_vm.sh delete`
2. delete the `vm/win11storage` folder
3. run `./manage_vm.sh create`

### libpaddle: The specified module could not be found
The OCR library used by OmniParser is Paddle that depends on C++ Redistributable on Windows. If you are on Windows ensure that you have installed it, then rerun installing the requirements.txt. More details [here](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser/issues/140#issuecomment-2670619168).

## Risks and Mitigations
To align with the Microsoft AI principles and Responsible AI practices, we conduct risk mitigation by training the icon caption model with Responsible AI data, which helps the model avoid inferring sensitive attributes (e.g.race, religion etc.) of the individuals which happen to be in icon images as much as possible. At the same time, we encourage user to apply OmniParser only for screenshot that does not contain harmful/violent content. For the OmniTool, we conduct threat model analysis using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool. We advise human to stay in the loop in order to minimize risk.

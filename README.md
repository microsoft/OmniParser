**OmniParser** is a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured and easy-to-understand elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. 

## News
- [2024/11/26] We release an updated version, OmniParser V1.5 which features 1) more fine grained/small icon detection, 2) prediction of whether each screen element is interactable or not. Examples in the demo.ipynb. 
- [2024/10] OmniParser was the #1 trending model on huggingface model hub (starting 10/29/2024). 
- [2024/10] Feel free to checkout our demo on [huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/OmniParser)! (stay tuned for OmniParser + Claude Computer Use)
- [2024/10] Both Interactive Region Detection Model and Icon functional description model are released! [Hugginface models](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser)
- [2024/09] OmniParser achieves the best performance on [Windows Agent Arena](https://microsoft.github.io/WindowsAgentArena/)! 

### :rocket: Docker Quick Start

Prerequisites:
- CUDA-enabled GPU
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed (https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
```
# Build the image (requires CUDA)
sudo docker build -t omniparser .

# Run the image
sudo docker run -d -p 7861:7861 --gpus all --name omniparser-container omniparser
```

## Install 
Install environment:
```python
conda create -n "omni" python==3.12
conda activate omni
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download and convert the model ckpt files from https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser:
```python
python download.py
```

Or, download the model ckpts files in: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser, and put them under weights/, default folder structure is: weights/icon_detect, weights/icon_caption_florence, weights/icon_caption_blip2.
Finally, convert the safetensor to .pt file. 

For v1: 
convert the safetensor to .pt file. 

```python
python weights/convert_safetensor_to_pt.py

For v1.5: 
download 'model_v1_5.pt' from https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser/tree/main/icon_detect_v1_5, make a new dir: weights/icon_detect_v1_5, and put it inside the folder. No weight conversion is needed. 
```

## Examples:
We put together a few simple examples in the demo.ipynb. 

## Gradio Demo
To run gradio demo, simply run:
```python
# For v1
python gradio_demo.py --icon_detect_model weights/icon_detect/best.pt --icon_caption_model florence2
# For v1.5
python gradio_demo.py --icon_detect_model weights/icon_detect_v1_5/model_v1_5.pt --icon_caption_model florence2
```

## Deploy to AWS

To deploy OmniParser to EC2 on AWS via Github Actions:

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork to your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions at the top of [`deploy.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser/blob/main/deploy.py).

## Model Weights License
For the model checkpoints on huggingface model hub, please note that icon_detect model is under AGPL license since it is a license inherited from the original yolo model. And icon_caption_blip2 & icon_caption_florence is under MIT license. Please refer to the LICENSE file in the folder of each model: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser.
